# Dynamo Graphs Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the Dynamo graphs in this repository.

## Geometry Category

### Rectangle Creation
The rectangle graphs provide simple geometric shape creation capabilities. Useful for basic geometry workflows and teaching purposes.

### Point Grid Generation
Point grid generators create parametric arrays of points that can be used for surface paneling, structural grids, and other design patterns.

## Analysis Category

### Wall Analysis
Wall analysis graphs extract and analyze wall parameters from Revit models. They can generate reports, check compliance, and export data to Excel for further analysis.

Common use cases:
- Height verification
- Material takeoffs
- Compliance checking
- Quality assurance
